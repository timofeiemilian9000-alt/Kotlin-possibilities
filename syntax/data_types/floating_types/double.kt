/*
    Use Float or Double?

    The precision of a floating point value indicates how many digits 
    the value can have after the decimal point. The precision of Float 
    is only six or seven decimal digits, while Double variables have a 
    precision of about 15 digits. Therefore it is safer to use Double for most calculations.

        Also note that you should end the value of a Float type with an "F".
